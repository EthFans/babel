**For a long time we have been public about our plans to continue improving the Ethereum protocol over time and our long development roadmap, learning from our mistakes that we either did not have the opportunity to fix in time for 1.0 or only realized after the fact. However, the Ethereum protocol development cycle has started up once again, with a Homestead release coming very soon, and us quietly starting to develop proof-of-concepts for the largest milestone that we had placed for ourselves in our development roadmap: Serenity.**

我们已经公开继续改进以太坊协议的计划和长期开发路线图相当长一段时间了，这个做法也是来自于从1.0版本发布之前或者事后没有能及时处理的错误中学到的经验。不管怎样，以太坊协议的开发已经重新启动???，Homestead阶段很快就要到来，我们也已经悄悄开始开发一个概念原型(PoC)，目标是开发路线图中最大的里程碑: Serenity.**
